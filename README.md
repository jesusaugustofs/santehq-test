This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Description

It is a simple yet dynamic contact list application. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on a list of contacts where each contact has a name, email and a phone number.

## Running The Project Locally

- Download the project and then run `npm install`
- Then run `npm run db:push` to build the User model
- Optionally you can run `npm run db:seed` and it will create 5 users
- Finally just run `npm run dev` and go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
